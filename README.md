# Ramses Composer

![](styles/ramses-composer-logo.png)

The authoring tool for the RAMSES rendering ecosystem.
Find the [user documentation here](https://ramses-composer.readthedocs.io/).
Find a broader overview of [the Ramses SDK here](https://ramses-sdk.readthedocs.io/).

## Setup

Make sure you have Git LFS installed:

```console
> git lfs install
Updated Git hooks.
Git LFS initialized.
```

To build Ramses Composer you first need to checkout and initialize it's dependencies:

```console
> git clone https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer ramses-composer
> cd ramses-composer
\raco> git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Environment variables

If your Qt installation is not in the default location (Currently: ```C:/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64```),
set the environment variable ```RACO_QT_BASE``` to it.

## Build with CMake

```console
\raco> mkdir build
\raco> cd build
\raco\build> cmake ..
\raco\build> cmake --build . --target RaCoEditor --config <CONFIG>       # <CONFIG> either Release or Debug
```

Ramses Composer is built on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019 and on Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc 8.4.0.

## Starting Ramses Composer

### Starting on Windows

The executable can be found in:
```console
\raco\build\release\bin\<CONFIG>\RamsesComposer.exe       # <CONFIG> either Release or Debug
```

Starting RaCoEditor with an extra console showing stdout (Windows only):
```console
\raco\build\release\bin\<CONFIG>\RamsesComposer.exe -c
```

Starting RaCoEditor with an extra console and configured ramses framework log levels:
```console
\raco\build\release\bin\<CONFIG>\RamsesComposer.exe -c -r '--log-level-contexts-filter info:RAPI,off:RPER,debug:RRND,off:RFRA,off:RDSM,info:RCOM --log-level-console trace'
```

RaCoEditor can also be given the initial project file as an command line argument:
```console
\raco\build\release\bin\<CONFIG>\RamsesComposer.exe <PATH_TO_PROJECT_FILE>
```
The ```<PATH_TO_PROJECT_FILE>``` has to be either an absolute path or relative to the current working directory.

### Starting on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)

The Linux release contains all required Qt shared libraries. Ramses Composer Headless and Ramses Composer can be started using the
provided shell script `./RaCoHeadless.sh` resp. `./RamsesComposer.sh`.

The shell scripts together with the `qt.conf` allow the localization of all required Qt shared libraries.

### The Python environment

Both the Windows and Linux versions of the Ramses Composer Python 3.8 environment can be found in `./bin/python*`. The environment
is [isolated](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init_config.html#init-isolated-conf) from the system and contains [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) for installing
custom modules. For more details how to install modules with pip, please refer to the Python section in the documentation.

### Locations

The various file locations are determined by the [PathManager.h](datamodel/libCore/include/core/PathManager.h). They are all relative to the executable.

#### Log file and Configuration files

The Ramses Composer looks for the the folder
```
../../configfiles
```
relative to its binary path. If the folder does not exist, Ramses Composer will automatically create it on startup.
The folder is also automatically created by CMake and can be found in the zip for the binary files.

Files in this directory are:
* layout.ini - Saves the layout and geometry information of the Qt application.
* RamsesComposer.log - Main log file.
* recent_files.ini - Saves the list of recent files opened with Ramses Composer.

#### Build process

The build process for the Ramses Composer generates a "release" folder in the CMake build directory which matches
the distributed zip-files - so after building Ramses Composer the developer will run Ramses Composer in the
same environment as the user.

## Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)

The linux build needs newer versions of CMake and Qt than available from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories. Install CMake >= 3.19 and Qt 5.15.2. It also needs gcc/g++ >=8 which is available from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories.

Installing Qt into /usr/local/opt/Qt/5.15.2 can be done like this:
```console
apt-get install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install aqtinstall
python3 -m aqt install --outputdir /usr/local/opt/Qt 5.15.2 linux desktop
```
Alternatively you can use the [official Qt installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).

The environment variable QTBASEDIR needs to be set to the Qt base directory when running CMake, e.g. to /usr/local/opt/Qt in the example above.

To build ramses renderer dependent project you also need to install OpenGL dependencies:

```console
sudo apt install libegl1-mesa
sudo apt install libegl1-mesa-dev
```

Further Python 3.8.0 needs to be installed to allow building Ramses Composer:
```console
sudo apt install python3.8-dev
```

## Development

### Logging system
Our logging system facade, which uses [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) as a backend, can be found in
```headless/libLogSystem/```.
To use the logging system link against the target
```raco::LogSystem```.
### Usage
```c++
#include <log_system/log.h>

using raco::log_system::COMMON;

...

int importantValue {43};
LOG_DEBUG(COMMON, "The important value is {}.", importantValue);
LOG(DEBUG, COMMON, "The important value is {}.", importantValue);
LOG_DEBUG_IF(COMMON, importantValue > 1, "The important value is {}.", importantValue);
```
We are using predifined log contexts (e.g. ```COMMON```, ```PROPERTY_BROWSER```) which are
predeclared in ```log.h```. If you need a new log context add it there and also initialize
a logger for this context during ```log_system::init()```.
Available log levels are ```TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL```.

Further information about capabailites and formatting can be found at [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) and [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).

### Testing
Example of how to use the raco::testing library:

```
set(TEST_LIBRARIES
    libRamsesBase
    raco::testing  # include testing
)
raco_package_add_headless_test(libRamsesBase_test
    "${TEST_SOURCES}"
    "${TEST_LIBRARIES}"
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}  # set working directory for test
)
raco_package_add_test_resources(libRamsesBase_test
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} # source directory for the resources below
    res/basic.frag
    res/basic.vert
    res/bunny.ctm)
```
This example will create the setup for having a working directory with the specified resources already copied when using the testing/RacoBaseTest.h fixture.

## Third Party Components

The UI is based on [Qt](https://www.qt.io). Qt is used as Open Source under the LGPL 3 license in the form of unmodified dynamic libraries from Qt 5.15.2. You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/bmwcarit/ramses-composer/releases/download/v0.8.1/qt-src-5.15.2.tgz).

Ramses Composer uses a number of third party libraries:

* Python
* glm
* googletest
* OpenCTM-1.0.3
* Qt Advanced Docking System
* RAMSES
* RAMSES logic
* spdlog
* tinygltf
* zip

Their source code and respective licenses can be found in the ```third_party/``` folder.
