# Crash dumps

Ramses Composer might crash during use. If it does, in nearly all cases it will generate a "dump file" called "RamsesComposer_X.Y.Z_DATE_TIME.dmp" next to the RamsesComposer.exe.

The dump file records the exact location of the crash in the code, and hence it is very useful when trying to track down crashes which are hard to reproduce. 

Please attach the crash dumps to bug reports about crashes if possible.
